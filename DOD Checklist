# About the Document
Definition of Done (DoD) is the exit criteria to determine whether a product backlog item (PBI) is complete.
DoD is a checklist of features and activities, for example, writing code, unit testing, integration testing,
design documents, etc. that demonstrates that the PBI has been completed and can be marked as Done.
DoD is crucial to a scrum team. It is the key to delivering quality product. DoD also serves as a good
reporting mechanism for scrum team members. It helps to say that “This feature is Done”. Using DoD as
a reference, a team member can effectively update other team members and product owner of the state
of a PBI.
DoD may vary from one scrum team to another, but must be consistent within one team. To ensure
consistent quality, it is important for a scrum team to identify its own DoD and stick with it. Any alteration
of DoD should be communicated to the team members immediately.
