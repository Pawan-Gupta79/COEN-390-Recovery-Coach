# COEN-390-Recovery-Coach
This repository is being created to save, edit and finalize code for the android app to be developed for the COEN 390 project by team 11. 

# Description 

We will be creating an app called recovery coach that will connect to a chestband or an arm band which includes a MAX30102 Heart Rate Oxygen Pulse Sensor Breakout to take user's heartrate during an exercise as input and sends it to the app as data. The app, after recieving the data and exercise done by user as input processes these inputs and the output is a personalized recovery advice that includes but not limited to a 10-20 minute post-workout stretching session, hydration, sleep and macronutrient recommendations for the user by taking in the user's age, biological gender, age, goals and more information to help user achieve optimum recovery and save the user's time and help them achieve their fitness goals.

There will be two types of account: 
    1. A user account used by any product user. 
    2. A professional's account that will be used by professionals like gym coaches and masseuses to get in contact with users and help them on their fitness journey.

We will also implement a user history features that allows the user to track their progress each month by their workout volume( number of repitions X wieght lifted per exercise/muscle group). This will motivate user to keep going, allow them to identify a=gaps in their training and thereafter customize their workouts too. 

# Objectives
In this project we will gain software development skills. We will use the Agile Scrum technique, which breaks the project down into four sprints, or incremental delivery and utilize wikis, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, GitHub distributed version control, access control, and bug tracking to enhance our project management process.
