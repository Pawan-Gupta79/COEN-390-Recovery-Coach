William proposes doing DS-03
alexander - proposes someone making code for fake hr data. 
pawan - takes the task for fake hr data. 
pawan proposes commenting code so everyone knows what is happening.
proposed - someone needs to do the login code clean up and make them into one file. 

How the UI should go :
On second page- session -> Choose workout -> 
On main page -> User clicks Start workout -> Workout and Session start simultaneously and user is said to choose a workout

second page - just info on previous sessions and an overview button . 

arnav- doing hardware 

assignments- 
arnav- doing hardware tasks, working on connection as well.
pawan - proposes someone making code for fake hr data. 
William proposes doing DS-03
thaos - working on different logins. 
alexander - ui changes to make app consistent
Victor - 

status of hardware - HW-01, HW-02 working, need to work on connecting to the app. 
Arnav proposes making a small simple app to connect to so know if it works, then integrate it into the main app. 

need to set up logic to take in continous data until the user presses stop activity/stop workout. 

discussion regarding hardware connection and Victor's tasks

another task for arnav - fixing arduino code bug so victor can work on bluetooth conection. need till Wednesday, 11 November.
once fixed, victor works on the bluetooth connection.

Scrum meeting 2 - Sprint 3

13 November, Thursday

Pawan-
What I did : Fixed the code for Fakeheartrate generation to test the app on fake data till we have sensor connection established. I had to revert to workable code and run the app to check if the code needed any changes to avoid confusions later on. 
Time spent: 5 hours
Work till next scrum meeting: Test and Defination of Done documentation, more work if feasible. 
Proposal for next scrum meeting time: Anytime next sunday on 16 November.

William –
What I did:
Stability Fix PR – restored the app after UI-8 regressions (Sessions, Workout, Settings).
DS-03 Secure Authentication – added hashed+salted password storage, unified login flow, account creation screen, and app-wide credential validation.
DS-04 BLE Heart-Rate Improvements – added HR packet parsing, spike filtering, smoothing, null-handling, and full unit test coverage (all passing).
Confirmed everything builds cleanly and works in-app.
I cannot test with the real HR sensor, so another team member will need to validate real BLE readings later.

Time spent: 12 hours total.
Work until next scrum meeting: Begin DS-05 + DS-06:
DS-05 (Reconnect System):
05.1 Reconnect state machine (Idle/Reconnecting/Connected/Failed + backoff).
05.2 Reconnect UI feedback (banners, status labels, retry prompts).
05.3 Reconnect integration tests.
DS-06 (Session Storage):
06.1 Create session row on Start.
06.2 Batch-insert HR samples.
06.3 Flush + finalize on Stop.
06.4 Schema validation / migrations.

Next meeting: Sunday, Nov 16 — anytime works for me.

Alexandre -
What I did: Tested the changes to make sure they are error free, researched how to modify overview section and started working on it
Time spent: 4 hours
Work till next scrum meeting: fully implement overview feature


Thomas -
What I did: -corrected the duplicate database and made sure the code still functioned using the new combined database.
            -removed duplicate menu bar icons
Time spent: 8 hours
Work till next scrum meeting: more complex sessions and workout logic.
